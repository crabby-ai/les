## **Les.rs** - Rust Cryptocurrency Exchange Library

An open source Rust high performance cryptocurrency trading API with support for multiple exchanges and language wrappers. written in rust(ü¶Ä) with ‚ù§Ô∏è.
This library provides a simple interface for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges from Rust. It supports a wide range of exchanges and makes it easy to access their APIs and perform common tasks such as getting account balances and placing orders.

## **Installation**

To install the library, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

Copy code

```toml
[dependencies]
les = "0.1
```

You can then use the library in your Rust code by adding the following to your **main.rs** or **lib.rs** file:

Copy code

```rust
extern crate les;
```

## **Supported Exchanges**

The following exchanges are currently supported by the library:

| Exchange | Available |
| --- | --- |
| Binance | ‚úÖ |
| Coinbase | ‚¨úÔ∏è |
| Bitfinex | ‚¨úÔ∏è |
| Kraken | ‚¨úÔ∏è |

More exchanges will be added in future updates.

## **Usage**

To use the library, you will need to create an instance of the **Exchange** struct, passing in the name of the exchange you want to use as a string. You will also need to provide your API key and secret key, which you can obtain from the exchange.

Copy code

```rust
let client = Binance::new(BinanceParameters {
        credentials: Some(BinanceCredentials {
            api_key: env::var("BINANCE_API_KEY").expect("Couldn't get environment variable"),
            api_secret: env::var("BINANCE_API_SECRET").expect("Couldn't get environment variable"),
        }),
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .await
    .expect("Failed to create Client")
```

You can then use the **exchange** object to call various methods to access the exchange's API. For example, to get the current balance of your account:

Copy code

```rust
let params = TradeHistoryReq {
                    paginator: None,
                    symbol: String::from("BNBBTC"),
                };
let binance_cli = client.inner_client().expect("Couldn't get inner time.");

let args = KlineParams{
            symbol: "BNBBTC".to_string(),
            interval: "1m".to_string(),
            paginator: None,
        };
let response = binance_cli.get_klines(&args).await.expect("Couldn't trade history.");
```

See the documentation for a full list of available methods and their usage.
